Danny, the owner of a small restaurant, wanted to analyze her business to better understand her customers,
 their visiting patterns, and their favorite dishes.
To help Danny, I used SQL to analyze the data, which allowed me to improve my SQL skills.
 During the analysis, I utilized functions like -CTE, window functions, JOINS,
 CASE WHEN, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY to gain insights into Danny's business.
By providing Danny with data-driven insights, I helped him make informed decisions that
 will enable him to improve customer satisfaction and grow his business. Overall, the case study was an excellent 
opportunity to practice and apply SQL concepts to real-world scenarios.
